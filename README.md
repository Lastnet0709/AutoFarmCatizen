# Catizenfarm

* Use the [main file]([https://github.com/RGB-Outl4w/CatizenAutofarm/blob/main/formattedaltscript.js](https://github.com/RGB-Outl4w/Catizenfarm/blob/rel/release_AutoFarmCatizen_telegramwebviewscript.js)) to use the script itself.

To use the script insert the following command into the Telegram webview console while having the app opened:
```fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RGB-Outl4w/CatizenAutofarm/main/formattedaltscript.js').then(response => response.text()).then(script => eval(script));```

Known issues:
  * The application sometimes crashes (devs' problem) and stops merging your cats, keeping you at the same progress. I have no current solution for this, the only hope is that the devs fix it on their side.
