* Use the [main file](https://github.com/RGB-Outl4w/Catizenfarm/blob/rel/release_AutoFarmCatizen_telegramwebviewscript.js) to use the script itself.

To use the script insert the following command into the Telegram webview console `(Ctrl + Shift + i)` while having the web app opened:
```fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RGB-Outl4w/AutoFarmCatizen/rel/release_AutoFarmCatizen_telegramwebviewscript.js').then(response => response.text()).then(script => eval(script));```

## What this script does:
* Automatically merges cats for you
* Automatically opens airdrops with cats


Known issues:
  * ~~The application sometimes crashes (devs' problem) and stops merging your cats, keeping you at the same progress. I have no current solution for this, the only hope is that the devs fix it on their side.~~ (seems to be fixed in the [main](https://github.com/RGB-Outl4w/Catizenfarm/blob/rel/release_AutoFarmCatizen_telegramwebviewscript.js) version)
