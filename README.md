* Use the [main file](https://github.com/RGB-Outl4w/Catizenfarm/blob/rel/release_AutoFarmCatizen_telegramwebviewscript.js) to use the script itself.

## Installation (Execution)
Access the **Telegram** webview inspection console ([guide on how to do it](https://telegra.ph/How-to-open-webview-inspecting-window-console-03-23))

Paste the following command into the command prompt:

```fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RGB-Outl4w/AutoFarmCatizen/rel/release_AutoFarmCatizen_telegramwebviewscript.js').then(response => response.text()).then(script => eval(script));```

## What this script does:
* Automatically merges cats for you
* Automatically opens airdrops with cats


Known issues:
  * ~~The application sometimes crashes (devs' problem) and stops merging your cats, keeping you at the same progress. I have no current solution for this, the only hope is that the devs fix it on their side.~~ (seems to be fixed in the [main](https://github.com/RGB-Outl4w/Catizenfarm/blob/rel/release_AutoFarmCatizen_telegramwebviewscript.js) version)
