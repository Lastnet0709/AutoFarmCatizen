# CatizenAutoFarm

* Use the [main file](https://github.com/RGB-Outl4w/Catizenfarm/blob/rel/release_AutoFarmCatizen_telegramwebviewscript.js) to use the script itself.

To use the script insert the following command into the Telegram webview console while having the app opened:
```fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RGB-Outl4w/CatizenAutofarm/main/formattedaltscript.js').then(response => response.text()).then(script => eval(script));```

## Info:
The original code is taken from t.me/mdsays and edited. The formatted version has some cut-offs and is obfuscated a bit better, as well as club dependency is removed here. Executing this script will not force you to join any club (the original one does), but you can join the t.me/mdsays club manually **in a sign of respect**. I myself am in this club and thankful to the devs of the script.

Known issues:
  * The application sometimes crashes (devs' problem) and stops merging your cats, keeping you at the same progress. I have no current solution for this, the only hope is that the devs fix it on their side.
